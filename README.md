# BI-and-datawarehousing-project
The project aims to analyze the business trends pertaining to accommodation industry in New
York City, one of the most expensive cities in the United States, which is comparable to the bay
area. By utilizing techniques of descriptive and predictive analysis, as well as multiple data
sources, an evaluation of the lead and lag measures in the property lending business space will be
made with a goal that this business analysis would foster the growth of such businesses in the
market. This ultimate goal can be achieved by employing the results of the analysis to provide a
data solution to Airbnbâ€™s potential hosts wanting to invest in properties in NYC as end users.
